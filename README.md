## About PET
The objective of this design is to create a system that enables efficient course planning for all University
of Toronto students by having the planning and selection tools in one place. This will be achieved by
ensuring the system includes functions that improve user experience. The primary benefit of the design
is that it saves the studentsâ€™ time to do course planning without having to navigate multiple websites.
